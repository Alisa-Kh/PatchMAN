**PatchMAN protocol for blind peptide-protein docking**

**Description**

PatchMAN (Patch-Motif AligNments), a novel approach that maps the receptor surface for local structural motif matches in structures of protein monomers and interfaces, to extract complementary fragments and derive templates for peptide-protein docking.
